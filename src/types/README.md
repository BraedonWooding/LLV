# Types

This maintains a collection of defined types for each of the various systems;

- 'LL_impl' refers to implementations of linked lists which can use these types to utilise a header/tail of the list.
  - Doesn't make the header/tail defined however.
- 'shared_types' refers to types that are shared amongst all areas; the printer, the implementations and the 'user code'.
