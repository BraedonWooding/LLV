# LinkedListVisualisation
A nice and simple way to visualise linked lists.

An example is under 'example.c' that shows the two lists as the elements are being reversed along with the currently removed item.  You can utilise the sleep functionality as you wish to make it sleep at any point, it is crossplatform.

NOTE: All the code should work across all platforms including windows, but I haven't tested it on windows, if there are bugs feel free to open an issue or make a PR :).

I haven't extensively tested the functions yet so there may be bugs, it is a pretty simple LinkedList implementation though so I wouldn't expect them.

Also note that the below image has the tick time quite low this is just to make it look nice as a gif, so you'll probably want to up that to make it so you can follow it, if set to 0 then it'll use manual stepping (enter to make each update pass)
